<h2 id="EarlyLife">Harry Styles' Early Life</h2>
<p class="standard">Harry Styles was born on February 1, 1994.  He was born and raised in the Western region of England in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire.  According to Biography.com, his parents divorced when Harry was just 7 years old and he would go on to be raised by his mother in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire (<a href="#Reference1"><em>Harry Styles</em></a>, n.d.).
Here is a picture of a young Harry Styles:

<h2 id="OneDirection"> Harry Styles' Tenure With One Direction</h2>
<p class="standard">One Direction, the globally famous group Harry was once a part of, was founded largely as a result of their performance on a Brittish game show, <em>The X Factor</em>.  Following success on the show, Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik founded One Direction.  The grouped signed their first studio contract in January 2011.  After selling countless global hits and creating what is viewed by some as a phenomenon, the group collectively chose to take a hiatus in 2015.  This was largely due to Harry's considerations for the tenure of the fanbase.
As Capital FM (2020) desribed, one of the main reasons for the 2015 hiatus was to take a break from the exhausting schedules the band had resulted in (<a href="#Reference2"><em>Why And When Did One Direction Break Up</em></a>).
The band has never formally called this hiatus the end of the group, but no notable, global hits have been released since.  The members, including Harry, have focused more on individual pursuits in the meantime.</p>

    <h2 id="AfterOneDirection">Harry Stles' Career After One Direction</h2>
    <p class="standard">The 2015 hiatus marked the beginning of a very fruitful solo venture for Harry Styles.  Less than a year later in 2016, Harry went on to sign his first solo record
        deal with Columbia Records.  Erskine Records, Harry's own label, was also founded at this time.  Later, in 2017, Harry would land a major role in the successful WWII film <em>Dunkirk</em>.
        From there, Harry would become very integrated into the fashion in popular culture scene.  Extremely popular songs, such as <em>Watermelon Sugar</em>, would catapult Harry into full-on stardom.
        It is quite astonishing to behold somebody who has had so much success both with a major group and as an individual act.  Between singing, acting, and fashion sense, there is no
        doubting that Harry Styles is a full on star.
